# README

### Why Rails

* Very mature community

* Rapid iteration speed

* Easy to find talent short & long term

### Why not Go

* Not optimized for web development

* Niche and expensive Talent

* Performance features not applicable to the use case

### Opinions

* Simple html generation for dashboards

* Single dashboard page on react

-> Low maintenance and very fast updates of fields and data
-> Opportunity to build a sophisticated experience in a single page (optimize for speed)

* Bootstrap > Material-UI

As a front-end developer I find Material-UI hard to work with (libraries are inconsistent and have very serious issues).
They are hard to use efficiently, and they are optimal for short consumer-based-interactions.

Bootstrap is much easier and reliable to work with, particularly if you don't have front-end experience. *Requires no styling, only structure*.

### Setup time

About 3 hours of reading documentation and punching through bugs to make:
 - install rails
 - create models & views with scaffolds
 - add react & bootstrap
 - figure out serialization
